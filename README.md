# Gencppm

A tool for generating cppm files to export symbols from a legacy header.

A tool to generate a cppm (C++20 Module) file that exports symbols declared in traditional headers. Extremely early in development and not really ready to be used in any form other than testing for bug reports.

# License information

The project adheres to the [REUSE spceification](https://reuse.software/spec/) for license info.

Full license text for all licenses used is available in LICENSES/

All text files in the repository aside from licenses themselves should have copyright headers at the start of the file or an entry in .reuse/dep5 specifying the copyright information.

If the copyright information is neither in the header nor in .reuse/dep5, the license is AGPL-3.0-or-later, but the absence of an explicit notice is probably a mistake and should be raised as an issue.
